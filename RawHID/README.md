# Raw HID

### This is not a complete HID library or somethig like it.

### It's just calling a few WinApi functions, to send Raw input data to a device, and that's it.

### [Introduction to Human Interface Devices (HID)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/hid/)

Todo: 
- add docs
- add Reading raw input asynchronously
